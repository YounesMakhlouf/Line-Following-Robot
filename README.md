## Description

The line-following robot is designed to navigate along a path marked by a contrasting color on the ground. It uses infrared sensors to detect the line and makes decisions on its movement based on the sensor readings.
We created it for a robotics competition, we called our baby 3abdejlil. Look at how cute he is.
